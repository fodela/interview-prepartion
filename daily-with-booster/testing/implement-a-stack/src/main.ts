// Medical students who code are a unique and valuable asset to the medical field. With the increasing integration of technology in healthcare, medical students who have a background in computer programming are well-positioned to not only understand and utilize these technologies, but also to innovate and create new solutions to improve patient care.

// Coding skills can benefit medical students in a variety of ways. For example, they can use programming to create and analyze data sets, develop new apps and tools for patient care, and even create simulations for medical training. Additionally, coding can help medical students better understand complex medical systems and improve their problem-solving skills.

// One medical student who has successfully integrated coding into her medical education is Erin Nelson, a third-year student at the University of Michigan Medical School. Nelson started learning to code in high school and continued to develop her skills in college. She now uses her coding abilities to create data visualizations and analyze data sets in her medical research.

// "Coding has allowed me to approach problems from a different perspective and think more algorithmically," Nelson said in an interview with the American Medical Association. "It's also been helpful in understanding the electronic medical record and other information systems we use in the clinic."

// In addition to the practical benefits of coding for medical students, having this skill can also make them more competitive in the job market. With the growing demand for technology in healthcare, medical students who can code will have an edge over their peers when it comes to finding jobs and advancing their careers.

// Overall, medical students who code are a valuable asset to the medical field. Their unique combination of technical skills and medical knowledge allows them to not only understand and utilize technology in healthcare, but also to innovate and create new solutions to improve patient care.
